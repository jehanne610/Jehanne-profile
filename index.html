			<h2>About Music 📝</h2>
			<p>I've always been a fan of music to the point of waking up and going to sleep with. What I find interesting about the music is its ability to help us get into the mood we want to be, because it's like a selfconfidence, we can find ourselves in it. But it also permits us to get out of a bad mood if we want to do. I personnally admire the people who are able to produce that type of song, I mean the one who every can listen and can like it. 
			Here is my favorite song for party :
